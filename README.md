# WhatToEatMVC
Initial version of the What To Eat application, helping indecisive people pick where to eat.  Simply choose someone to choose food with, and then the application will give you suggestions to like or dislike and find a good middleground for the both of you.

This will be a part of a incremental application, with new features being added over time, and eventually jumping to new frontend frameworks, though much less important.

This particular project will not be the focus of learning, rather the culmination of it.  When I have learned something new that I can apply from somewhere else, I may come back to this and implement it, but it will be to further cement a concept rather than learn it for this project.
